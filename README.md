<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## What I learned:

This project is a clone of Twitter and is quite challenging to make due to the complexity of database structure. The relationships for user who is followed and following are very interesting to study. In addition, deploying the app to Heroku was not easy even for this second time. Along the way, there were many issues to be debugged. Nevertheless, my effort was paid off at the end. Looking forward, I plan to clone another social media platform with Node.js and Express to dive deeper into database structure and logic of functionalities.
